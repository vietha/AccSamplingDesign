Description: Provides tools for designing and analyzing Acceptance Sampling plans.
    Supports both Attributes Sampling (Binomial and Poisson distributions) and 
    Variables Sampling (Normal and Beta distributions), enabling quality control 
    for fractional and compositional data. Uses nonlinear programming for sampling 
    plan optimization, minimizing sample size while controlling producer's and 
    consumer's risks. Operating Characteristic curves are available for plan visualization.
